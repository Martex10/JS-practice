// used a loop inside a loop to make a grid. chess board. while doing this i found
// that as long as i kept running my head into the wall would eventually find the 
// answer. its something rare that i get frustrated. and i found for this that the 
// frustration only came when i was destracted. 

/*i got very far with this one and only needed help with getting the board to work when
line was an odd number. after looking at the solution i realized that haveing i + j ment that 
the first character of each line would always alternate and give the desiered pattern*/
