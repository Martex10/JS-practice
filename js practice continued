// i want to have a program that will ask the same question untill answered correctly so a loop is needed 
//not just if else statements -but ill do one to make sure i have the proper syntax

// let responce = prompt("Are we there yet?!");
//  if(responce === "yes" || "yea");
//     alert("Yay, We made it!");
// }

// i read chapter 2 in eloquent javascript and i think a code block useing switch may work 

// switch (prompt("Are we there yet?!")){
//     case "yes":
//         alert("Yay, We made it!");
//         break;
//     case "yea":
//         alert("Yay, We made it!");
//         break;
//         default:
//         prompt("Are we there yet?!");
//         break;
// }
//this does not work as far as i can tell. i cant figure out how to loop it back 

// let responce = prompt("are we there yet");
// while( responce !== "yes" || "yeah"){
//     prompt(responce);
// }

//it seams i keep making endless loops
//found out i can put the variable or binding in side of the while loop 

//  var responce = prompt("Are we there yet?!");
//  while( responce !== "yes" && responce !== "yeah") {
//     var responce = prompt("Are we there yet?!");
// }
// alert("Yay, We made it!");
//it seams that we needed to use && instead of || and rewrite the 
//i found out that useing let binding is not able to work in side of the while loop as it needs to be global.
//it seams that the let is not working

//FIZZ BUZZ 

//ok first lets write a program that prints 1 to 100
var buzz = 5;
var fizz = 3;

for(var num = 1 ; num <= 100 ; num++){
    if(num % fizz === 0 && num % buzz === 0){
        console.log("FIZZ BUZZ");
} else if(num % fizz === 0){
    console.log("FIZZ");
}else if(num % buzz === 0){
    console.log("BUZZ");
}else{
    console.log(num);
}
} 

// it took me a while to get this one afteri counted from 1-100 i added if else to write FIZZ and BUZZ and 
//FIZZ BUZZ but they apeared next to the number rather then replacing it.
//i tried adding a switch statement but the script always ended after replacing 3 with FIZZ
//i then researched continue. i found that it is supose to have the ability to continue the program
//i placed it below the break statement thinking that it would continue but that is not what happened a
//and i didnt know why. i also found out that i could completely write the if else statement all the way out
//with out useing break or continue.
